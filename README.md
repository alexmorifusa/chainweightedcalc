# CHAIN WEIGHTED REAL GDP CALCULATOR

#### Description: I am currently studying economics and data science at a university so I decided that I wanted to combine what I learned in economics and code something that could assist my learning. In macroeconomics, I learned about Real GDP which measures the growth of gross domestic production accounting for inflation. But a method to find a more accurate real GDP growth is by using the chain weighted method, a method that finds the geometric average of real gdp growth rates. Although this method does lead to a more accurate result, it is extremely tedious and one small calculation error can lead to the whole process falling apart. I struggled to study practice problems because I was unsure if the answer I ultimately calculated was right. I decided to code a chain weighted real GDP calculator so users can check if their calculations were right and also so users can find a more accurate real GDP.

#### In project.py I coded a Data_Storage class where users can input and store the amount produced and sold and the cost of each product. Since the year, product name, and product number must be the same between the years to calculate real GDP, I wrote fuctions outside of the class to get these variables. Below the variable getters and setters, I have all the calculations needed which is ultimately called and summarized in the calculator function.

#### To calculate chain weighted real GDP, one must first find the real GDP of each year using the year's costs and also the real GDP of each year using the cost of the other year. The year which the price is being used is called the base year. After 4 real GDP's are found, one must calculate the real GDP growth between the two years by dividing the real GDP of the second year with the first year where each year uses the same base year. To find the chain weighted real gdp growth factor, one needs to multiple the two growth rates and find the square root of them. Using the chain weighted real gdp growth factor, one can find the chain weighted real gdp of each year by multiplying the first year real gdp that uses the first year as base by the chain weight growth factor to find the chain weighted real GDP of the second year and dividing the second year real gdp using the second year as base with the chain weighted growth factor to find the first year's chain weighted real GDP.

#### As you can tell, the process is extremely complicated and tedious. Having a program that organizes the data into a table so users can visualize the data, while also doing the calculations for them will help students double check their practice problems and also make the lives of users who are simply looking for the chain weighted real GDP for certain products a lot more simpler.
